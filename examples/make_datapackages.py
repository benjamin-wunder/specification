#
# This script makes datapackge.json files suitable for checking examples against and writes them to each examples directory.
#
# You can then validate them:
#
#    python examples/make_datapackages.py
#    pip install frictionless
#    frictionless validate examples/all_resources/datapackage.json
#    frictionless validate examples/simple/datapackage.json
#        ... etc
#
# Reason we have to do this and we can't just use the original datapackage.json:
#
# If a single data file does not exist the validator crashes out and will then not validate the data files that do exist.
# So we make a new datapackage.json that contains only the definitions for the files that do exist.
# (If the validator carried on and validated the rest anyway that would not be needed,
#   but I can't see a way to make this validator do that)
